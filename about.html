 <p class="about-intro"> I am a self taught web developer, building projects and pursing Treehouse's Tech Degree. My long term goal is to establish myself as a leader and developer within a company. I pursued a career in software development because I want to bring people's visions to life. Coding satisfies my drive for a challenge and creativity.</p>
